# Vue Node Application

In the frontend folder there is an initial design skeleton in Vue.js and Vuetify that communicates with the backend using axios.
In the backend folder there is the initial skeleton of a Node.js project that has an API-REST using Express. In this project, the persistence layer uses MongoDB, through the Mongoose framework.
The main differential of this project is the Docker configurations and docker-compose at the root of the project. On a machine with docker installed it is possible to start the frontend and backend services on the same machine. Just install Docker first.
